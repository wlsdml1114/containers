# RunPod Containers

This repository contains the Dockerfiles for the RunPod containers used for our official templates. Resulting containers are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/runpod).

## Changes

The containers `serverless-automatic` and `sd-auto-abdbarho` have been removed from this repository. The worker replacement can be found in the [runpod-workers/worker-a1111](https://github.com/runpod-workers/worker-a1111) repository.
