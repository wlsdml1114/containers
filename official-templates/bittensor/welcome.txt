------------------------
/root is the default volume mount for this template. 
All your work should get saved there!
Please note that you should run 

pm2 save 

once you have set everything up.

This template should attempt to pm2 resurrect on any interruption to the pod.
You can test this by manually resetting or restarting your pod after you have set things up and run

pm2 save

Thank You! :)
